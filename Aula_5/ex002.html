    <h1>JavaScript Basic Concepts #1</h1>
    <p>
        Hello! Today I will gonna show you some of JS basic concepts. 
        <br> example: vars, primitive types and commentaries on code.
    </p>
    <h2>Comments and Annotations</h2>
    <p>
        First of all, you need to keep your code clear for those who 
        <br> read it in the future. Thinking on this, the creators
        <br> of JS and some other languages add symbols who basically
        <br> says to the compiler "ignore this line"/"ignore this lines".
        <br> This symbols are, respectfully: "//" for one line annotations
        <br> and the symbols "/*", "*/" to delimit the ignored parts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you already know how to track your knowledge inside the code
        <br> we will learn what variables, how they work and how to declare
        <br> them.
    </p>
    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>
        Variables are elements that make presence, if not all, in almost
        <br> all programming languages. They are responsible for creating
        <br> slots in the server/computer memory to store user data.
    </p>
    <h3>Naming Your Variables</h3>
    <p>
        - An variable name can start with: letter, $ or _
        <br> - Can't start with numbers
        <br> - It's possible tu use letters and numbers
        <br> - It's possible to use accents and symbols
        <br> - Can't contain spaces
        <br> - Can't be reserved words
        <br>
        <br><b>Examples:</b> Ex.1: userName  /  Ex.2: userAge  /  Ex.3: userGender
    </p>
    <h3>Primitive Types</h3>
    <p>
        In the last example you can see that we show you variables that are
        <br> supposed to receive letter and numbers as answers. Variables are
        <br> able to receive many different types of data, and these data types
        <br> have subtypes. Here are a list of the types that we can work with
        <br> in using JavaScript:
        <br>
        <br> - Number
        <br> + Infinity
        <br> + NaN (Not A Number)
        <br>
        <br> - String
        <br>
        <br> - Boolean
        <br>
        <br> - Null
        <br>
        <br> - Undefined
        <br>
        <br> - Object
        <br> + Array
    </p>
